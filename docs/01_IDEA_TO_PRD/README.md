# 01_IDEA_TO_PRD

## Purpose

This folder contains prompts for the **Discovery Phase** — transforming raw ideas and discussions into formalized Product Requirement Documents (PRD/RPD).

These prompts ensure that business intent is captured accurately without technical assumptions or scope creep.

## When to Use

**At the very beginning of a new product or feature.**

This is Stage 1 of the governance workflow:
```
ORIENTATION → DISCUSSION → PRD → Architecture → ...
```

## Who Should Use This

- **Business stakeholders** during ideation sessions
- **Product owners** formalizing requirements
- **ChatGPT** (not Antigravity) for brainstorming and consolidation

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Invent requirements not stated in discussions
- ❌ Add technical implementation details
- ❌ Skip stakeholder validation of the PRD
- ❌ Proceed to architecture before PRD is locked

## Typical Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Mixing business and technical concerns** — PRD is purely business intent
2. **Adding "nice to have" features** — Only capture what was explicitly stated
3. **Using Antigravity for discovery** — ChatGPT is for discussion; Antigravity is for execution
4. **Not flagging conflicts** — If stakeholders disagree, mark it as [CONFLICT]
5. **Assuming scope** — Mark unclear items as [AMBIGUOUS]
