SYSTEM CONTEXT — REPOSITORY ORIENTATION

You are working inside a STANDARDIZED TEMPLATE REPOSITORY.

This repository is NOT a playground.
It is a controlled, Ops-first, audit-first system.

========================
REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
========================

/src
  /modules        -> Business logic only (Ops rules, decisions)
  /api            -> Entry points only (no business logic)
  /shared         -> Cross-cutting utilities (logging, errors)
  /config         -> Configs & constants (no logic)

/docs
  /tech-manual    -> Technical truth (logic, data, constraints)
  /user-manual    -> Operational truth (flows, meaning)

/templates
  -> COMMENT & FILE STRUCTURE TEMPLATES
  -> You MUST follow these when writing or modifying code

========================
NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
========================

- You MUST read existing docs before doing anything
- You MUST respect folder responsibility
- You MUST NOT create files outside this structure
- You MUST NOT redesign architecture
- You MUST NOT add features
- You MUST NOT optimize unless explicitly instructed

========================
HOW YOU SHOULD WORK
========================

1. First, identify WHICH document or file you are asked to produce
2. Locate the correct folder for that output
3. Follow the existing template & comment standard
4. If information is missing or unclear:
   - Make a conservative assumption
   - Explicitly note it
   - Do NOT invent

Acknowledge this orientation.
Then wait for the actual task.
