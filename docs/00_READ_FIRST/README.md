# 00_READ_FIRST

## Purpose

This folder contains **foundational materials** that must be read and understood before using any other prompts in the library. These documents establish the philosophy, rules, and mental models that govern all work in this repository.

## When to Use

**Before starting any project work.**

- New team members: Read **02_NEWBIE_GUIDE.md** first
- Returning users: Review **01_ONE_PAGE_CHEAT_SHEET.md** for quick reference
- Context reset: Use **03_FAQ_COMMON.md** to recall project state

## Who Should Use This

- **Anyone** new to the Thái Mậu development workflow
- **All users** at the start of a new project
- **Returning users** who need to refresh context

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Skip this folder when starting a new project
- ❌ Use implementation prompts before reading orientation materials
- ❌ Modify these files without governance approval
- ❌ Treat these as optional reading

## Typical Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting code before understanding philosophy** — Read OVERVIEW_SYSTEM first
2. **Forgetting the session workflow** — The cheat sheet exists for a reason
3. **Assuming you remember the rules** — Context drift happens; re-read when unsure
4. **Not acknowledging the orientation** — Antigravity requires explicit acknowledgment
