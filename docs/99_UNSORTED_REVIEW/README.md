# 99_UNSORTED_REVIEW

## Purpose

This folder contains **specialized prompts** that do not yet fit the standard governance workflow. These are typically used when **building new applications from scratch** or implementing **decision engine logic**.

This is a **holding area** for review and potential reorganization.

## When to Use

**Only for advanced use cases:**

- Building Decision Engine rule catalogs
- Creating ChatGPT memory reminder formats
- Cloning Antigravity kit for new projects
- Session type classification logic (advanced)

## Who Should Use This

- **Advanced users** building custom systems
- **Architects** designing decision governance
- **Maintainers** reviewing prompts for reorganization

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Use these prompts for standard projects
- ❌ Skip the main workflow in favor of these
- ❌ Assume these are production-ready
- ❌ Mix with governance-controlled prompts

## Typical Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using before understanding governance** — Master the main workflow first
2. **Treating as official prompts** — These are under review
3. **Not validating outputs** — These may need refinement
4. **Duplicating functionality** — Check if main prompts cover the need
5. **Skipping documentation** — If you use these, document what you did
